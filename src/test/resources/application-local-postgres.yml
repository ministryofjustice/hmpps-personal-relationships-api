#
# The "local-postgres" profile is for running the API integration tests against a Postgres TestContainer instance.
# It would normally start the test container with a random host port and export the JDBC URL, database, username and password
# as properties to the current environment, overriding the properties given below. However, we've configured the startup
# of the test container to expose the Postqresql default port 5432/tcp on localhost.
#
# The default port exposed by the TestContainer on localhost can be overridden by providing the required port in an
# environment variable POSTGRES_TEST_DB_PORT=5555, in your .env local configuration file.
